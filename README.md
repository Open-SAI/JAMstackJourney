# The JAMstack Journey
The Web is dead long life to the Web!

* how to run any web property, from simple sites to complex applications, on a global Content Delivery Network (CDN) and without a single web server
* If you tend to feel delivering great websites should be more about the craft of markup and JavaScript than server setup and administration, you’ve found...
* if you’ve ever struggled with any monolithic system or framework wrestling with hosting, deploying changes, securing, and scaling everything—you already understand why the JAMstack is becoming so popular
* HTML is prerendered into static files, sites are served from a global CDN, and tasks that were once processed and managed server side are now performed via APIs and microservices
* JAMstack brings together JavaScript, APIs, and markup
* JAMstack sites are well suited to meet the demanding requirements of today’s mobile-first web
* JAMstack isn’t: it’s not any one specific technology in and of itself; nor is it driven by a large company;  nor is there any standards body that controls or defines it
* JAMstack is a movement, a community collection of best practices and workflows that result in high-speed websites that are a pleasure to work on
* JavaScript is called out specifically as the language of the browser, but you can use as much or as little JavaScript as your project requires. Many JAMstack sites also use Python, Go, or Ruby for templating and logic 
* Not everything about the JAMstack is a new idea, but it’s only very recently that we’ve had the technology required to make the approach possible
* By nature, JAMstack sites are the following:
  * Globally distributed and resilient to heavy traffic
  * Centered around a developer friendly, Git-based workflow
  * Designed modularly, consuming other services via APIs
  * Prebuilt and optimized before being served
* Shouldn’t new HTML be produced only when content or data changes, not every time it is requested?
* No more dreaded delays waiting for the CDN’s cache to expire we can now build highly distributed sites right on the edge of the network and remove the need for any type of frontend servers to pro‐
cess each request
* live in a Git repository right alongside the code and templates
* no content database is required
* Complex staging environments are no longer needed as previewing and testing changes use the branching system built into the heart of Git 
* The JAMstack has spawned a clever new generation of authoring tools that look and function like a normal Content Management System (CMS) but actually check changes into version control behind the scenes
* NO requiring a database that you need to manage and version separately
