# The JAMstack Journey
The Web is dead long life to the Web!

* how to run any web property, from simple sites to complex applications, on a global Content Delivery Network (CDN) and without a single web server
* If you tend to feel delivering great websites should be more about the craft of markup and JavaScript than server setup and administration, you’ve found...
* if you’ve ever struggled with any monolithic system or framework wrestling with hosting, deploying changes, securing, and scaling everything—you already understand why the JAMstack is becoming so popular
* HTML is prerendered into static files, sites are served from a global CDN, and tasks that were once processed and managed server side are now performed via APIs and microservices
* JAMstack brings together JavaScript, APIs, and markup
* JAMstack sites are well suited to meet the demanding requirements of today’s mobile-first web
* JAMstack isn’t: it’s not any one specific technology in and of itself; nor is it driven by a large company;  nor is there any standards body that controls or defines it
* JAMstack is a movement, a community collection of best practices and workflows that result in high-speed websites that are a pleasure to work on
